#### Functionality
+ A three or above hopefully. I believe the encrypt and decrypt are working fine and I have the cracking interface partially working-- isn't able to make a key but can crack correctly from the runner

#### Object Oriented Programming
+ I think a 3. My methods are doing one thing, none of them are overly long and I think they work in a logical manner. I use inheritance to improve the organization of my code but I don't know if it is enough to get me into the next grade.

#### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
+ I see around a 3 here. Only one method in the cracking class is 11 lines long. I use hashes in various places throughout, I think I am using the appropriate enumurables and at the very least I can explain why I am using them  

#### Test Driven Development
+ I think a 3 here. I am at 100% coverage on simple cov. I wrote my tests before I wrote the code(with the exception of some helper methods) I use mocks and stubs but don't know if their use is enough to push me into a higher catagory .
