When the rules of the new format came out, our first idea was to try Guzzlord immediately. With the Dynamax it has an immense number of HP (660) and can be used well as a Trick Room abuser thanks to its typing and its ability. In fact, after going to +2 thanks to the Weakness Policy activated by Dusclops with Brick Break, Guzzlord easily takes a kill going to +3 with the Beast Boost and dropping the Special Defense by 1 with the Dark-type Max Move. Basically in one turn it is as if Guzzlord went to +4 Special Attack considering the drop, allowing you to snowball entire teams.
